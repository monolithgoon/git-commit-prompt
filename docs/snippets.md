### _Wrong_

```javascript
!parseCommandRsponse(error) && return true;
```

It seems like you're trying to use the logical AND operator (&&) and the return statement in a single line. In JavaScript, the return statement is not used in conjunction with && in this way. Here's the corrected expression:

### _Correct_

```javascript
return !parseCommandResponse(error);
```

If parseCommandResponse(error) is truthy (evaluates to true), then !parseCommandResponse(error) is false.
If parseCommandResponse(error) is falsy (evaluates to false), then !parseCommandResponse(error) is true.
